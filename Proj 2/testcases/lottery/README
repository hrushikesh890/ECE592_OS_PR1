NOTE: For all the test cases QUANTUM must be set to 10 (kernel.h) 

RECOMMENDATION: Use the test case files in the following order

(1) lottery_ctxsw
=======================
Tests the sequence of context switches on short running, CPU-intensive processes. Constant DEBUG_CTXSW must be defined.

(2) lottery_burst_ctxsw
=======================
Tests the sequence of context switches on short running processes exhibiting burst execution. Constant DEBUG_CTXSW must be defined.

(3) lottery_counters
=======================
Tests the relative use of the CPU by various mixes of CPU-intensive processes.

(4) lottery_longrunning
=======================
Performs tests on long running processes (only runtime, turnaround time and number of context switches are recorded).
 
EXPECTED DEVIATIONS FROM TEST CASE RESULTS: The test cases should help you debug your code. Keep in mind that the results can slightly change from run to run (and from system to system). In particular, the following differences do *not* indicate a problem in your code.

- In test cases (1), (2) and (4), the running and turnaround times might vary (by a couple of ms) from run to run. For the runtime, some runs will show 1 ms more than expected. More significant runtime and turnaround time differences might indicated a problem in your code, but a couple of ms can be expected.

- In test cases (3) the numbers shown represent percentage values. These percentage values are rounded. You can expect the results to change slightly (typically by +/-1) from run to run.

- On long running test cases, the number of context switches my vary slightly (+/-1)
